__MORE ABOUT ME..__ frequent hyperfixations,, i do __not__ take people who say slurs they can't reclaim lightly (unless it's an accident, and/or didn't know it was..) well. i will genuinely make fun of you. frequent bad moods and anger issues- i guess i can also be annoying??

i don't take "doubles" to my "IRLS"
