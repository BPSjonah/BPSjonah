- easily annoyed due to anger issues. i'm sorry if i randomly lash out/snap at you, i promise i'm not angry or anything.
- despite me being easily annoyed, i can be annoying.
- no tone tags needed, but if you need them yourself i can use it around you.

![cutie](https://barbara.crd.co/assets/images/gallery27/343757db_original.gif?v=66afe876) ***NOTE***, stated in my carrd; idk if the people i hang out with r problematic or not, so just let me know if they've done something bad. i would very much appreciate it if there was **evidence* so i would believe it as i need proof before i do something.
